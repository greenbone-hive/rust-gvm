# Implementation Status

Last updated: 2026-09-03

## Support Direction

rust-gvm is intended to track current GMP/GVMD behavior directly. python-gvm compatibility remains useful for migration, interoperability, and validation, but it is a secondary target rather than the project's product boundary.

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the version support stance, compatibility policy, known coverage gaps, and follow-up work.

## Crate Status

The `next` Technology Preview lane now includes the first statically associated
typed-execution slice. `GmpRequest` binds a semantic request to one
`GmpResponse`, and `GmpClient::execute` preserves existing command gates,
redacted tracing, parsing, and compatibility APIs. Version/authentication,
target list/get/create/clone/modify/delete, and asynchronous report export prove the
contract before family-by-family migration. See
[ADR 0001](adr/0001-typed-request-response-execution.md) and the
[typed-execution guide](typed-execution.md).

The first focused Phase 2 batch, tracked by
[`#539`](https://github.com/greenbone-hive/rust-gvm/issues/539), migrated the
standard scan-task list/get/create/clone/modify/delete/start/stop/resume
lifecycle to the same typed execution contract.

The deferred task-variant Phase 2 batch, tracked by
[`#553`](https://github.com/greenbone-hive/rust-gvm/issues/553), completes that
task-family boundary with semantic requests for import/container, agent-group,
OCI/container-image, web-application, and move operations plus the complete
audit-scoped lifecycle. Each specialized request delegates to its existing
builder, including compatibility aliases, and the typed facade delegates to
generic execution without changing wire bytes or response models. Agent-group,
OCI/container-image, and web-application task requests preserve their GMP 22.8
semantic gate before the shared `create_task` wire command can be sent. Raw
builder calls receive the same shape-based pre-send protection.

The credential-focused Phase 2 batch, tracked by
[`#544`](https://github.com/greenbone-hive/rust-gvm/issues/544), migrates the
core credential list/get/create/clone/modify/delete lifecycle. Existing
builders remain the single byte-compatible encoders, and the existing core
credential convenience methods remain source-compatible wrappers over generic
typed execution. Credential-store operations stay separate because their
vault, preference, semantic-alias, and version-policy shapes require a focused
follow-up.

The credential-store Phase 2 batch, tracked by
[`#551`](https://github.com/greenbone-hive/rust-gvm/issues/551), migrates store
list/filter/detail, verification and preference-bearing modification, plus
store-backed credential creation and modification. Existing builders remain
the byte-compatible encoders. The generic `create_credential` and
`modify_credential` wire roots retain explicit credential-store semantic names,
so their GMP 22.8 gates run before transmission; existing facade methods now
delegate to generic execution. Preference values retain wire-trace redaction,
and raw/custom execution remains supported.

The scanner-focused Phase 2 batch, tracked by
[`#542`](https://github.com/greenbone-hive/rust-gvm/issues/542), migrates the
scanner list/get/create/clone/modify/delete/verify lifecycle. Scanner builders
remain the single byte-compatible encoders, and the existing convenience
methods remain additive wrappers over generic typed execution. Scan
configurations remain a separate later batch because they include larger and
more specialized command surfaces.

The scan-config/policy Phase 2 batch, tracked by
[`#549`](https://github.com/greenbone-hive/rust-gvm/issues/549), migrates every
operation owned by the scan-config command family: scan configurations and
policies, import, preference retrieval and mutation, NVT/family selection, and
global synchronization. The generic config builders remain the single encoder,
import validation still happens before transmission, and a typed preference
response preserves both default and configuration-scoped shapes. Existing
convenience methods delegate to generic execution; raw builders, `send`, `call`,
and the deprecated global-sync compatibility shim remain supported.

The alert-and-schedule Phase 2 batch, tracked by
[`#555`](https://github.com/greenbone-hive/rust-gvm/issues/555), migrates every
public alert and schedule builder to semantic typed execution. Alert list,
detail, create, clone, modify, delete, test, and report-trigger operations keep
their established response shapes, including the report response returned by
triggering. Schedule list, detail, create, clone, modify, and delete retain both
raw compatibility options and typed recurrence input. Existing builders remain
the sole wire encoders and all facade helpers delegate to generic execution.

The supporting-resource Phase 2 batch, tracked by
[`#557`](https://github.com/greenbone-hive/rust-gvm/issues/557), migrates the
complete filter and tag list/detail/create/clone/modify/delete lifecycles plus
trashcan empty and restore operations. Existing builders remain the sole wire
encoders, both restore builder names retain byte-identical behavior through
distinct semantic request values, and all facade helpers delegate to generic
typed execution without changing response or version policy.

The note-and-override Phase 2 batch, tracked by
[`#559`](https://github.com/greenbone-hive/rust-gvm/issues/559), migrates both
complete list/detail/create/clone/modify/delete lifecycles. The list/detail and
create/clone pairs remain distinct semantic request types despite sharing wire
roots and response models. Existing builders remain the sole XML encoders,
including optional relationship fields, omit/replace/clear host updates, and
ultimate-delete behavior; all facade helpers delegate to generic execution.

The identity-and-permission Phase 2 batch, tracked by
[`#561`](https://github.com/greenbone-hive/rust-gvm/issues/561), migrates the
complete user, group, role, and permission list/detail/create/clone/modify/delete
lifecycles. Each semantic request delegates to its existing builder, preserving
user authentication, role, host-access, and relationship-update shapes while
the facade methods delegate to generic typed execution. Existing raw builders,
response models, and compatibility APIs remain supported.

The NVT-and-SecInfo Phase 2 batch, tracked by
[`#563`](https://github.com/greenbone-hive/rust-gvm/issues/563), migrates all 19
public query builders to semantic typed execution. Global and scan-config NVT
list/detail requests, NVT preferences, and family discovery preserve their
distinct intent while delegating to the established builders. Generic
`get_info` list/detail requests use a generic response model for all supported
resource kinds, while CPE, CVE, advisory, operating-system, and vulnerability
requests retain their specialized response codecs. Existing facade methods now
delegate to `execute`; explicit SecInfo operating-system and vulnerability
helper names avoid changing the distinct asset and legacy `get_vulns` APIs.

The asset-and-result Phase 2 batch, tracked by
[`#566`](https://github.com/greenbone-hive/rust-gvm/issues/566), migrates the
complete generic asset, host alias, operating-system asset alias, and result
query surfaces to semantic typed execution. Generic list/detail/create/modify/
delete requests and their resource-specific aliases remain distinct Rust types
while delegating to the existing `get_assets`, `create_asset`, `modify_asset`,
and `delete_asset` builders. This preserves type selection, filters, detail
flags, ignored compatibility fields, asset deletion semantics, and exact XML
bytes. Result list/detail requests likewise retain their existing `get_results`
encodings. All corresponding facade helpers use `execute`, while raw builders,
`send`, and `call` remain supported.

The alternate-target Phase 2 batch, tracked by
[`#567`](https://github.com/greenbone-hive/rust-gvm/issues/567), completes the
existing target command boundary with the remaining standard target clone plus
all OCI-image and web-application target list/detail/create/clone/modify/delete
operations. Each operation has a distinct semantic request and delegates to its
established public builder, preserving filters, relationship fields, mutation
behavior, and exact XML bytes. The OCI-image and web-application families
retain their GMP 22.8 gates while standard target cloning remains baseline.
All twelve existing `_parsed` facade helpers now delegate to `execute`;
builders and raw/custom execution remain supported.

The agent-and-integration Phase 3 batch, tracked by
[`#568`](https://github.com/greenbone-hive/rust-gvm/issues/568), migrates all 17
public agent, agent-group, and integration-configuration builders to semantic
typed execution. Existing agent and agent-group typed helpers and the parsed
integration helpers now delegate to `execute`, while the raw integration
methods, builders, and response models remain supported. All requests preserve
their GMP 22.8 pre-send gate, and installer instructions, identifier
collections, integration secrets, and binary/base64 support bundles retain
their established wire and decoding behavior.

The irregular-report Phase 3 batch, tracked by
[`#546`](https://github.com/greenbone-hive/rust-gvm/issues/546), migrates report
list/detail, structured scan and audit reports, audit hosts, nine structured
report drill-downs, and synchronous report-format export. Existing explicit
parsers remain authoritative for binary/base64 exports, nested XML exports,
mixed/repeated response elements, and large bounded responses. Existing typed
helpers delegate to generic execution, while raw builders and versioned/raw
helpers remain supported. Version policy stays explicit: audit operations are
22.7+, scan/drill-down/synchronous-export operations are 22.8+, and
`export_scan_report` still requires positive help discovery.

The remaining report-mutation Phase 3 batch, tracked by
[`#576`](https://github.com/greenbone-hive/rust-gvm/issues/576), adds semantic
requests for report creation, XML import, deletion, and audit-report deletion.
Create and import retain distinct Rust request types over their shared
`create_report` wire root, while both deletion forms preserve the established
`delete_report` encoding. The existing typed import helper now delegates to
generic execution without changing validation, base64 payload handling,
response parsing, or raw compatibility APIs.

Schedule create/modify supports typed first-run input and once, hourly, daily,
weekly, and yearly recurrence. Schedule observations expose normalized typed
first-run/next-run timestamps reported by gvmd and distinguish floating or
`TZID`-qualified starts, recurrence dates, exclusions, and unsupported recurrence
rules from one-time schedules; raw iCalendar remains available for compatibility.
Raw create follows gvmd's default-timezone behavior, and raw modify requires an
iCalendar payload.

Target create and modify inputs use validated `TargetHost` values inside a
non-empty `TargetHosts` aggregate. The aggregate de-duplicates canonical values
across alternate address/network/range spellings and makes included/excluded
modify updates atomic. It can test whether exclusions cover every included
specification without expanding networks, using gvmd's usable-address treatment
for CIDRs; trailing-dot hostnames remain distinct from undotted hostnames.
IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, CIDR networks, address ranges, and ASCII hostnames are
rejected locally when malformed; IPv4 leading zeroes are normalized like gvmd,
and CIDR prefixes follow gvmd's `/1` through `/30` restriction. Unicode hostname
case-fold lookalikes are intentionally outside the typed API's accepted hostname
policy. DNS resolution and deployment policy, including gvmd's configured maximum
IP count, remain server-side. Typed creation models manual hosts; the stateful raw
mock also resolves gvmd-style `asset_hosts` filters, with filter precedence over a
supplied manual host list.
The same strict filter evaluator drives `get_assets` and target resolution,
including quoted values, relations, sorting, and pagination. Raw mock target
storage applies gvmd-style trimming, separator cleanup, and exact textual
de-duplication without rewriting otherwise valid host spellings.

| `timeout` | 60s | TCP connect, TLS handshake, request write/flush, and response-read timeout |
| `max_response_bytes` | 64 MiB | Bounded XML response size |

### Error Types

| Variant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `NotConnected` | Operation requires active connection |
| `AlreadyConnected` | Double-connect attempt |
| `ConnectFailed` | Transport-level connection error |
| `SendFailed` | Write error |
| `ReadFailed` | Read error or unexpected EOF |
| `Timeout` | Operation exceeded configured timeout |
| `InvalidConfiguration` | Trust roots, server name, or certificate/key material is unusable |
| `SocketNotFound` | Unix socket path does not exist |

### Integration Tests (against gvm-mock-server)

| Test | Status |
|------|--------|
| Connect + get_version | ✅ |
| Auth + create_target | ✅ |
| Reconnect flow (python-gvm pattern) | ✅ |
| Timeout invalidation and clean reconnect | ✅ |
| Not-connected error paths | ✅ |
| Double-connect error | ✅ |

Once an active transport returns a send or read error, it is invalidated. Callers
must reconnect before issuing another request; this prevents partial writes or
late responses from being associated with a later GMP command.

## gvm-gmp

Typed GMP command builders covering all entity types, system commands, and enums. Full rustdoc coverage.

### Target Port-List Updates

`ModifyTargetOpts::port_list_id` models omission and replacement with
`ScalarUpdate<EntityId>`. Current gvmd accepts a real port-list UUID when
replacing the relationship, but it does not define a sentinel or other wire
representation for detaching an existing port list. Consequently,
`ScalarUpdate::Clear` is rejected locally with
`ModifyTargetError::UnsupportedPortListClear`; no GMP request is sent.

`CreateTargetOpts` requires a `TargetPortSelection`, enforcing a typed one-of
choice between an existing `<port_list>` and a validated direct `<port_range>`.
Raw GMP also permits both, with gvmd validating the range before giving the port
list precedence. Direct ranges support gvmd's implicit TCP and protocol
carry-forward grammar, and validate the `1..=65535` port domain and ascending
range bounds before canonical serialization.

### Target Credential Service Ports

`CreateTargetOpts` and `ModifyTargetOpts` expose the SSH service port next to
the credential relationship. `ServicePort` validates the gvmd-supported
range `1..=65535`; typed target observations reject zero, nonnumeric, and
out-of-range backend values instead of losing malformed data. Both list and
single-target client reads preserve effective default and custom ports.

This is an intentional pre-1.0 API break: create ports use
`Option<ServicePort>`, modify ports use `ScalarUpdate<ServicePort>`, and the
low-level `create_target` builder now returns `Result` so a port without an SSH
credential ID fails explicitly. The high-level client exposes the same failure
as `GvmError::CreateTarget` before any request is sent.

Modify requests distinguish leaving the binding untouched, setting or replacing
the port, resetting it to gvmd's default port 22, and detaching the credential.
The reset operation keeps gvmd's numeric sentinel internal to the command
builder. The stateful mock mirrors these defaults and round trips SSH and SMB
credential identifiers, but rejects SMB service ports because current GMP/gvmd
only defines a nested port for the SSH credential. It also rejects create-time
detach sentinels and credential types that gvmd does not allow for SSH or SMB
target bindings.

The stateful mock also preserves target alive-test values. Stateful responses
and create/modify requests use gvmd's plural `alive_tests` field. The typed
request option remains named `alive_test` for source compatibility. Target
responses without an explicit alive-test value report `Scan Config Default`,
matching gvmd's observation behavior.

## gvm-client

High-level async `GmpClient<C>` and `GmpVersioned<C>` that combines `gvm-connection`, `gvm-protocol`, and `gvm-gmp`. Connects, negotiates GMP version (22.4–22.7+), and provides typed `send`/`call` methods.

|---------------|----------------|
| 22.4 | `GmpVersioned::V224` |
| 22.5 | `GmpVersioned::V225` |
| 22.6 | `GmpVersioned::V226` |
| 22.7 | `GmpVersioned::V227` |
| 22.8+ | `GmpVersioned::Next` |
| < 22.4 | `GvmError::UnsupportedVersion` |

### GvmError

| Variant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Connection(ConnectionError)` | Transport failure (preserves source chain) |
| `Server { status, message }` | Non-2xx GMP response |
| `XmlParse(String)` | Malformed version/response XML |
| `Parse(ParseError)` | Typed response model parsing failure |
| `UnsupportedVersion(major, minor)` | Server GMP version too old |
| `Timeout(Duration)` | Operation timeout |
| `InvalidState(String)` | Client state error |

### Typed Client Methods

Convenience methods on `GmpClient<C>` that combine `send()` + `XxxResponse::from_response()` into a single typed call. Implemented in `crates/gvm-client/src/typed.rs`.

| report | ✅ | — | Also: typed report drill-down helpers for vulns, TLS certificates, errors, closed CVEs |
| result | ✅ | — | |
| feed | ✅ | — | |
| nvt | ✅ | — | Also: `get_nvt_families()` |
| secinfo | ✅ | — | CVE, CPE, CERT-Bund, DFN-CERT |
| alert | ✅ | ✅ | |
| credential | ✅ | ✅ | Also: `get_credential_stores()` |
| filter | ✅ | ✅ | |

| group | ✅ | ✅ | |
| role | ✅ | ✅ | |
| permission | ✅ | ✅ | |
| host | ✅ | ✅ | |
| tls_certificate | ✅ | ✅ | |
| report_format | ✅ | ✅ | |
| report_config | ✅ | — | `get_report_configs_parsed()` |
| system | ✅ | — | `get_settings()`, `get_help()`, `describe_auth()`, `get_timezones()` |

## CI Pipelines

| Pipeline | Status | Jobs |
|----------|--------|------|
| CI (push/PR) | ✅ | fmt, clippy, test, test-all-features, doc, deny, coverage, MSRV, python-gvm |
| Security | ✅ | cargo-audit, cargo-machete |
| Nightly | ✅ | Full CI + 5-target cross-platform builds + SBOM generation + sbomqs quality gate |
| Release | ✅ | Full test → 5-target builds → SBOM + sbomqs → GitHub Release |

## SBOM Quality

SBOMs are generated by `cargo-cyclonedx` (CycloneDX 1.5 JSON + XML) and post-processed via `scripts/sbom_postprocess.py`:
- CC0-1.0 data license in document metadata
- Build lifecycle phase (`build`)
- Supplier hints: workspace crates → `clawosiris`, crates.io deps → `crates.io`

Quality gate: **sbomqs ≥ 7.0** enforced in CI (nightly + release).

## Security

- **SECURITY.md** — vulnerability reporting via GitHub Private Security Advisories
- **cargo-audit** — RustSec advisory database checks (weekly + on push)
- **cargo-deny** — license compliance, bans, source restrictions
- **Dependabot** — automated dependency updates (Cargo, pip, GitHub Actions)
- **cargo-machete** — unused dependency detection
